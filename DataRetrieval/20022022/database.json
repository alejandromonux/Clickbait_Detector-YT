For my Cypriots watching, I wish you peace and prosperity for the future. I hope you enjoyed this piece and understand that not every single detail of the story could be highlighted. I could've spent hours going into all of the intricacies of this conflict and tried to stay balance and unbiased as I simply came an observer.\n\nVarosha is one of the largest and most tragic ghost towns on the planet. Once filled with tens of thousands of tourists every year it's been abandoned now for about 47 years... The conflict in Cyprus is far from being resolved and unfortunately is growing in complexity as the years go by.

Learning that Nas did the entire first verse of \u201cNY State of Mind\u201d in one take with his whole crew in the booth with him, or that Slum Village laid all the vocals for \u201cFan-Tas-Tic (Volume 1)\u201d to a click track and then Dilla created the beats after the fact (what???? ), or that Bill Withers\u2019 band grooved on \u201cUse Me\u201d for 10 minutes straight in the studio before Bill laid his vocals (so that what we hear as the downbeat of the album track is actually preceded by a long stretch of hypnotic grooving that went straight to the cutting room floor\u2026 there\u2019s one way to make sure the pocket is deep right from the \u201cfirst notes\u201d)\u2026 this is the type of stuff that really gets me fired up.\n\nFor myself as a rapper, PROCESS has always been a huge part of my story. Freestyling off-top is all about improvising new lyrics in the spur of the moment. Fans of Freestyle Rappers are typically less interested in hearing them recite their pre-existing lyrics verbatim, and much more excited to watch the PROCESS unfold as the emcee cooks up brand new lyrics in the moment, based on their mood, the latest article they read, the vibe of the beat, the energy in the room, visual stimuli, or the topic suggestion they\u2019ve just been given. \u201cFreestyling\u201d quite literally describes a PROCESS, and thus a Freestyle Rapper is someone known for their mastery of a particular PROCESS. \n\nWith this project, I wanted to experiment with a few different PROCESSES to challenge myself creatively and see what emotions/vibes I could channel. The first 2 songs are extremely raw and vulnerable, the last song is much more polished. I think both approaches have merit and can lead to interesting results. In general, it\u2019s much scarier to release music that isn\u2019t based on someone else\u2019s words (a la Omegle Bars) because I don\u2019t have that safety net of saying \u201coh yeah, well I just rapped about that because they asked me to.\u201d But as I say in the last song: \u201cmy theory is embrace fear\u201d, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in deciding to release these tracks out into the wild. I hope you enjoy, and I\u2019m super curious to hear which PROCESS yielded the most enjoyable results for you as a listener- let me know in the comments.\n\nMuch love!\nMack \n\n#HarryMack #Freestyle #SOULilloquies\n\nINSTRUMENTALS\n1) 'Blood, Sweat, and Tears' (Prod.

We started at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas where I can be seen warming up the stage for a famous r&b singer we\u2019re all very familiar with (no spoilers!! \u2014 this is also the one and only opportunity to see me rapping alongside go-go dancers, so that\u2019s fun \ud83d\ude02). Next we took it to the LEGENDARY San Jose Improv - a stage that\u2019s been graced by the likes of Harry Houdini & Charlie Chaplin - where I performed for the hypest audience I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to rock for (shout out to The Bay, y\u2019all are my heart \u2764\ufe0f). Lastly we did some dope pop-up performances at SF Ski Fest (and we mayyyy have even found some time to sneak in a bayside Guerrilla Bars shoot for good measure). After this little run, I\u2019m more fired up than ever to do more out-of-town shows in the coming year.

I finally carved out some time to do just that, and it felt GOOD. The result is this mini 3-track EP called Rap Coltrane. Nothing was written or planned out ahead of time- everything is completely improvised in the moment off the top of the dome, just the way I like it. I hope y\u2019all enjoy \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nJohn Coltrane has long been one of my all-time favorite musicians. He was such an improvisational force of nature- always fearlessly pushing the boundary of what was possible on his instrument and in his genre. He changed the game irreversibly for saxophonists and jazz improvisers of all kinds. As someone who\u2019s passionate about elevating the craft of freestyle rapping and taking it to places it\u2019s never been before, I find endless inspiration in looking to legends like Coltrane, Rakim, J Dilla\u2026 the ones who made such an undeniable mark on music that nothing could ever be the same again. \n\nThere\u2019s this one live recording where the last song ends, and you can hear Trane continuing to play through an exercise AS HE\u2019S EXITING THE STAGE! He had just poured his heart out in front of an audience for however long, and he still wasn\u2019t ready to put the horn away- there was always more discovery to be done. I remember hearing that and thinking \u201cdamn, this guy is obsessed with practicing too! Maybe I\u2019m not crazy!\u201d Or maybe I am, and maybe that\u2019s ok.\n\n#HarryMack #Freestyle #RapColtrane\n\nTRACKS\n0:00 - 3:54 | Rap Coltrane\n3:55 - 7:59 | Snake Eyes\n8:00 - 12:16 | No Apology\n\nINSTRUMENTALS:\n\"Cold Blooded\" (Prod.

I add spices, such as gochujang with is a red chili paste that is sweet, with fermented spicy chili powder. Or you could use the instant ramen noodles called \"Rabokki.\" Rabokki noodle is made for the tteokbokki or the spicy rice cakes to be added to the mix. Rabokki is actually my favorite Korean ramen instant noodles of ALL TIME. Seriously, if I could only eat one Instant korean ramyeon aka Ramyun for the rest of my life, it would be Rabokki Instant Ramen Noodles, with cheese and rice cakes added. So sit back and relax and watch up cook up this delicious Easy Spicy Cheesy Rice Cakes mukang eating show!

As ya'll know, I've been separated from my ex husband Orlin Home for 2 months now, and we are in the filing process of the divorce. I packed my bags and moved to Las Vegas, a place I have always enjoyed for the food and company. I've been very fortunate and blessed, especially in 2020, despite the hardships in my marriage, from creating my new Mukbang channel called \"More Nikocado\" as well as monetizing myself on a few other platforms outside of YouTube. I truly owe this new home to all of you. This condo rests near the Las Vegas strip and was on the market for only a few months before I was able to purchase it back in January of 2021. If you may recall, my daily mukbang videos involved lots of hints of \"a big surprise is coming but I can't tell you yet\" type of stuff. Down below me is hotel, casino and spa. I'm so close to all of my favorite foods and the building has great security, which is why I feel comfortable publishing my location like this. I'm excited, nervous, and sad to start this new chapter, as I'm leaving behind somebody who I thought would be in my life forever. It's bittersweet. I hope you enjoy my house tour. I've filmed a few mukbangs in here already, too. You can find them on my More Nikocado channel or by clicking here if ya want to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eymE18Fa9Uo&list=PLs5NFD_oMEXzOkUM25X0pKkOgnJLQvWGD", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Heart Attack Grill With Hungry Fat Chick (20,000 Calorie Burgers) \u2022 MUKBANG", "description": "Thank you Helix for sponsoring!

Play alone or team up in online co-op. Explore the streets of Praslav, scavenge for food and supplies, beg, steal, and do whatever else it takes to survive the forthcoming winter.\n\nWelcome to Praslav, a cold Central European city that grows even colder with the coming winter. Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades.\n\nWhile most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the streets with nowhere to go.\n\nYou are one of those people.\n\nKeep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways - staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point.\n\nHow far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely outweigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are.\n\nSpend the last few days of autumn wisely \u2013 gather supplies, equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty - every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again.\n\nUnlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav.\n\nMaybe there is no warm apartment waiting for you at the end of the day, but you do not have to keep sleeping on park benches either. Find a suitable place and get to work. Construct walls and roofs to shield you from the elements. Gather discarded furniture and curios to furnish your hideout and make it truly your own.\n\nIs surviving on your own too difficult? Get the gang together. The game supports online co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. Play alone, together with your friends, or even with total strangers. Team up, collect resources, build a shanty town, survive the winter.\n\nFor over a decade, no one has been able to bring the many factions of the homeless together. The throne of the Homeless King has been sitting empty for far too long. Who will earn enough respect and prove themselves worthy of uniting the homeless? Will you rise to the occasion?", "rating": 0}, {"title": "I Built a Theme Park That Ends Reality in Planet Coaster", "description": "Download WARPATH through my link: https://patron.me/LGIOWarpath\nUse my creator code to get awesome in-game rewards: WARPATH2021\nJoin the event to have a chance to win a PS5, Switch, or tons of Amazon Cards.

I've made a few multiplayer games in the past, but nothing on this scale. it's heavily inspired by a bunch of survival multiplayer / roguelike games that i enjoy, like Valheim, Minecraft, Rush, Risk of rain & more. It's pretty scuffed, might get some updates out in the future. thanks for watching :)\n\n//about\nHey! If you're new here, welcome!

It ended up being not the best idea ever, and theres even this thing called google cardboard vr, so google straight copied me, but its fine, as long as google accepts my boxing match invitation. Anyway in the next episode we'll make a proper vr headset with arms, so i dont have to use my face to scream with, cuz thats kinda hard. Making a vr headset and vr games was fun tho, and ill probably get my hands on a real vr headset soon, maybe the valve index or like the oculus rift s or maybe just the oculus quest. all the games are made with unity btw, but i didnt use the vr support cuz im dumb lol. anyway thanks for watching and why are you reading this? you know this is just metadata right get outta here kiddo before i slamdunk\n\nAnyway would you wanna see me make a proper vr game with a proper vr headset? could be fun, and i think its pretty easy to make vr games with unity, so ill probbaly do it gamers\n\nAlso if you wanna try this for yourself, there are many video on youtube actually, like \"how to make virtual reality cardboard headset\" or something like that, and usually they make vr headsets from stuff you can find in your home, so its something to try out. tho obviously if you have some milk cartons lying around, i recommend you try building the oculus milk, as its an absolute unstoppable machine\n\n//about\nHey!

Pulling all the commens from accross my channel, and then finding my top 10.000 fans / top 10k commenters on my channel. Then I build a game where a bunch of cubes fight eacother, and finally load the comments into the players. Then all the players will get stats in the battle royale game, depending on how many comments they have on my channel. The game runs fine with 10,000 players, and could probably even do more. \nHope you enjoy this weird idea, I have some ideas for similar stuff as well, so make sure you slap subscribe.\nAlso thanks for the crazy response on my video \"He said I Couldn't Make a 3D Game...

For the first part of the game, I will focus on making a bunch of minigames you play with your friends, or bots if you dont have any friends like me haha anyway all the previous progress is definitely not lost. I'm probably going to add parts of it as their own minigames later on. And even if I don't, I will still take with me all the experience from previously developing, as seen in the devlogs. \nHopefully this way, development should be much quicker, and I might actually be able to release it sometime in 2020, but I'm not too sure on the date yet, as I'm still working on a lot of planning, and i also have a ton of other game / video ideas. \nAnyway, thanks for sticking around, this is gonne be sick\n\n\n//about\nHey!

You can also cover with a damp cloth, you're just keeping it from drying out. You can also just hot box a small room with a humidifier for all I care. \n\nCut your dough in half  unless you want to make a thick crusted pizza in a 12 inch pan or a bigger one on a cookie sheet \nGrease up your pan and spread out the dough with your fingers.

The taste was so perfect, but the texture was just divine. I knew I had to come up with my own recipe to recreate this scrambled egg masterpiece. \n\nThese eggs reminded me so much of being in France. And if there\u2019s one thing the French know, it\u2019s how to make eggs; trust me on this one! \n\nWhen I went to purchase the eggs to make this recipe they didn\u2019t have the organic eggs I normally buy. I thought about getting the free range eggs but they\u2019re honestly just not the same. A lot of marketing goes into those egg labels but everyone knows that organic is always best. I ended up walking 7 minutes to another store to find the organic ones, and boy was it well worth it. Plus I burned of some extra calories which really revved up my appetite! \n\nI harvested the chives from a friends herb garden. I\u2019m sure going to owe her one! I guess I\u2019m gonna have to make her one of those mimosas ;) \n\nAlright, well let\u2019s get to it. The recipe: \n\n3 organic eggs \nFresh chives \nFresh ricotta cheese \nSalted organic butter \nSalt and pepper to taste \n\nFinely chop the chives until you have around a tablespoon or so. Remember this doesn\u2019t have to be perfect! I end up putting in a different amount every time.\n\nCrack three eggs into a bowl and whisk. Feel free to add in some salt and don\u2019t let anyone tell you it makes the eggs tough or watery! Salt breaks down protein and if anything it will make them just slightly more tender. \n\nHeat your pan to medium low. Be patient with this. Add in some butter (not too much!) then pour in your eggs. \n\nScrape the bottom of the pan with your silicone spatula until the eggs are almost set, just a bit undercooked. \n\nStir in two tablespoons or so of fresh ricotta cheese, and remove the pan from the heat.\n\nSpoon the eggs onto some delicious whole grain toast and serve with fruit of choice. The contract in texture between the crunch toast and the soft eggs is to die for. \n\nNow that\u2019s what I call perfect scrambled eggs :) \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Onion Rings (episode 124)", "description": "Thank you to Bushmills Whiskey for sponsoring this video  http://www.inflcr.co/SH6HK\n\nDeep fried onion rings are one of the best edible hoops in existence. Onion rings are far better than apple rings, carrot rings, and also rings. \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\nhttp://yousuckatcooking.com\n\nBefore we get into the recipe, let's talk safety. A hot pot full of oil is super dangerous. You can deep fry safely but you have to know what you're doing. The first time I tried it, I was dipping my meat thermometer in the oil to keep track of the temperature. This was colossally stupid. You need a dedicated thermometer on your pot so you can watch constantly and so you won't drop it inside. Better yet, a dedicated deep fryer is really the way to go, and you can just read the instruction manual. Long story short, if your oil temperature gets out of control a fire can start, and you can't put it out with water, you either have to smother it or use a fire extinguisher. Also, the oil takes FOREVER to cool down, so many sure anyone in your house knows not to touch it when you're done using it. It also takes FOREVER to heat up so it's super tempting to turn up the temperature, which is a mistake (on my stovetop, 350 F was just below the number 4. Anyway, read this guide if you think you actually want to try deep frying, and then just order onion rings from the bar instead. \n\nDeep Fry Safety \nhttps://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-deep-fry-safely\n\nRecipe \n\nSlice some onions and make rings\nRemove tape\nYeah basically take any onion you like \nAdd \u00be cup of flour and \u00bc cup corn starch to a bowl \nThen add spices; cayenne, chilli powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, whatever. Let's say around a tablespoon total \nAdd around a cup of soda water, more or less, depending on how buck wild you've gone with the spices. One description I read about the thickness is that it should be like thick paint. \n\nHeat 3 or so inches of peanut oil to 350 degrees F in a tall sturdy pot (not non stick)\nPreferably on your back burner so it won't get knocked. If your vessel has handles, make sure they are not sticking out \nI see a lot of people use their fingers to put things into the oil. I don't like this method because that's too close for comfort. The spider strainer, in my opinion, is the best way to go. The chance of dropping something in the oil is very minimal. If you're going to use tongs, grip tightly, and I don't recommend silicon tipped tongs because they are slippery. You REALLY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE AN OIIL SPLASH \nSo use your spider strainer to lower an undoh ring into the oil\nAfter a minute or a minute and a half, flip it, then take it out after another minute. Just trust your eyes in terms of how cooked you want it \nI highly recommend setting a timer each time you put a batch in as it's easy to get distracted for one minute and you really have to have your head in the game for as long as you are deep frying \nPlace onion rings on a wire rack with paper towels underneath. If you don't have a wire rack you can place them on paper towels on a plate or in a bowl \nWhen you're all done, move that oil to the back burner if it's not already there (very, very carefully, using oven mitts), and make sure everyone knows not to touch it for a couple hours. Keep your thermometer in there so you know when it's completely cooled\nThen you can either save it or dispose of it. Here's a helpful guide on how to dispose of the oil...long story short, it will end up in the trash, not the sink or toilet \nhttps://www.thespruceeats.com/how-do-i-dispose-of-used-cooking-oil-908995\n\nThanks!
