If it resonated with you, share it with a non-tf2 player to keep this amazing game going. Everyone deserves to play a bit of TF2 if you ask me\n\nI now have a Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/LazyPurple \n\nSMALL disclaimer that I couldn't really fit in the video: this video is not meant to bash heavy and pyro. I personally love using the flamethrower and minigun, but they are inherently less interactive than the rest of the weapons. Heavy and Pyro's playstyles have more to do with positioning than dueling. They just don't fit the theme I talk about in this video. However, it should be noted that Pyro and Heavy did launch with shotguns as secondaries, so you could argue that they have always lowkey had a single-fire weapon as part of their kit\n\nAlso, I play on a lot of no-crit servers lol, random crits can mess up what I talk about in this video.\n\nI am determined to continue making high-quality content.

I think the bits are still pretty funny, at the time of editing I just saw them so many times I got used to them if that makes sense?

I think this is also an interesting unconventional mechanic, one that translates well into VR, but right now there are very few fleshed out examples of it. Shattered Lights, Spellboud Spire, and Hyperbolica are really promising demos of the idea but at the moment but they are very short, so it was hard to fit it into a script which is already all about a certain mechanic (sound/physics). I will probably make a part 2 to this video in the future, part of which will include these games. Right now, i'm a little tired of wearing a headset all day! So the next video's gonna be non-vr.\n\n0:00 'Conventional' VR Games\n1:41 Stifled\n3:34 Stifled (Rating)\n3:42 Blind\n5:34 Blind (Rating)\n5:42 NO LONGER AVAILABLE (but still funny)\n6:38 Half-Life Alyx (no spoilers)\n8:16 Half-Life Alyx (YES SPOILERS)\n10:34 Half-Life Alyx (Rating)\n10:40 Outro\n\n'FUNKe Study' is a series of reviews, sometimes quickfire and sometimes longform typically centered around unorthodox/novel media that I find worth highlighting. They started off on my second channel but now they're here on FUNKe, and while i'm still carving out the formula for these videos I expect them to continue to use mixed media/animation in conjunction with my normal gameplay/commentary style.",

The Big Band fight music was made by me, it's basically an improvised version of 'Landing of Yuri Gagarin (https://youtu.be/t5DEr8zrsn4)\"\nEnding song was also by me, which is an improvised version of 'The Good Life'.\n(full version of my outro: https://youtu.be/6a_9HQW1VmY)\n\nIf you're curious, i've tried to make the FPS idea in UE4 before. I built the aforementioned 3 lane map, some rudimentary movement, and a weapon that launched bombs a-la the loose cannon. I lost the files to this last october during a computer re-build, and since this video is more performative than it is practical I didn't really want to try and remake it again. Maybe things will change and i'll try to make games myself one day, but that's not really how I balance my plate right now.  Thx 4 watch.\n\nIf you want to make any of these ideas, I'm 100% cool with it.

I'm so thrilled to share content with you that isn't shot within my four walls!\nDaily Updates on Insta - https://www.instagram.com/louisepentland/?hl=en\nMy New Website - https://www.louisepentland.com/\n\nKrishan the most amazing stylist - https://www.instagram.com/krishanparmar_/?hl=en\nLo the most amazing MUA -\nNicky the most amazing photographer - \n\nI wouldn’t normally put a disclaimer in the description but despite things easing, I wanted to be super clear. This trip was well planned! We did a few things differently to increase everyone’s safety like using cars instead of the tube, having a reduced team on the shoot to minimise numbers, and spreading out into a bigger studio etc etc. You will note that when I’m being photographed, having my makeup done or presenting clips to cam stood alone, I am not wearing a mask. This is allowed (a bit like films, tv or modelling, not that I’d call myself a ‘model haha) and we made sure to all stay apart. I won’t lie, it felt a bit weird to note be covered up 100% of the time, I’ve become SO used to it!\n\nI conducted a poll on instagram and asked if you wanted to see disclaimers like this across content (you know me, I'm a people pleaser) and over 28,000 of you said no, you just wanted to see the lifey bits. So, I'm jotting in this bit rather than waffling on in the video.\n\nI know there will come a time where people are less and less required to distance or mask and I know the rules are different in other regions/countries but I just thought I’d leave that there for anyone who has a particular interest in it. I'm not sure how many videos I'll do this for, will have to just gauge the reaction.

      "description": "I’M GOING ON TOUR IN ONE WEEK HOLY SHIT 🤯🤯🤯 Get your tickets here: https://www.harrymackofficial.com/shows\n\nA lot of people say to me “yo Mack, if your live shows are fully improvised, why do you still have to rehearse?” It’s a good question- it seems like if everything’s off-top I should be able to just run out on stage and start winging it. But the truth is, there are certain pre-established forms that I like to use to ensure my freestyle performances function more like actual songs as opposed to just extended free-flows. Some of you have probably seen examples of this in Omegle Bars; for instance when I take 3 words, spin them all into a hook, and then proceed to do a verse dedicated to each of those 3 words. That’s just one example of a form I might use to give structure to my improvisation. In addition, the live show is packed with a bunch of different segments that showcase different sides of my freestyling. But the biggest reason I like to rehearse is to build chemistry with my DJ @Sur Jazz 💪 He’s a huge part of the overall sound and vibe we bring on stage, and I’m super lucky to have him on board for my tour. In this video, you get to take a behind-the-scenes look at how we get the creative juices flowing and prepare to absolutely demolish these stages.

      "description": "COME SEE ME ON TOUR: http://harrymackofficial.com/shows\n\nIn this episode of Omegle Bars (everyone’s favorite series where I freestyle for random strangers on the internet and try to blow their minds) we reminisce on the delicious, thirst-quenching beverage of our childhood: Capri Sun. Oh how I used to love breaking the rules and viciously stabbing that flimsy yellow straw right through the side of the packaging (rather than through the convenient little entry point they put there for the boring rule-followers among us 🙄). Let’s be real- it’s hard to earn your cool points as a 1st grader in the American public school system; sometimes you just have to get creative with your juice consumption strategy to prove your edginess. And if sipping juice out of a plastic pouch that you’ve just brutally stabbed while basking in the Sun on the Italian island of Capri doesn’t ping any nostalgic memories for you… maybe you played “Sonic” for Sega Genesis, or watched the cartoon series “Recess”, or at the very least cracked up at Bart yelling “eat my shorts!” while remaining completely oblivious to the fact that so many funnier jokes would only enter your comprehension years later in life. And if none of that means anything to you then I guess our respective childhoods are nothing alike. Regardless, there are a lot of dope bars in this episode, and I truly hope you enjoy 🙏🏻❤️ Don’t forget to share!!\n\nInstrumentals:\n1) 'Champion' (Prod.

      "description": "COME SEE ME LIVE ON TOUR!! https://www.harrymackofficial.com/shows\n\nAnd now for something completely different… 🥁🥁🥁 I’ve been wanting to do a video like this for the longest time, and I’m so happy we finally made it happen. I often mention how important my drumming has been to my development as a freestyler, and to my understanding of music in general. Back at the old home studio I didn’t have enough space to keep my drums set up all the time, and as a result I spent a lot less time playing them. One of the best parts about moving into my new studio space has been always having my kit set up and ready to play. Over the course of the past few months I’ve been really reconnecting with the instrument, and in the last couple weeks especially I’ve been playing almost daily. It’s been enriching for my soul, and I’m excited to share a little piece of that with y’all.\n\nThe beats I’m playing are lifted from some of the most sampled records of all time. These breaks (the original ones) are foundational to the DNA of hip-hop. My verses were freestyled completely off-top and I attempted to weave in a bunch of references- some to artists and groups who have sampled the breaks themselves, as well as other musical (and some non-musical) influences and inspirations. 20,000 Mack points to the first person who successfully identifies every allusion made!! \n\nCombining rhythm and language is what I’m all about, and this video is intended to show that connection. The first instruments utilized by human beings were drums (or probably sticks on cave walls) and the voice. There’s something visceral and deep about the stripped down sound of those two instruments alone. I had a lot of fun making this video and I hope y’all dig it! As always, don’t forget to share 🙏🏻❤️🚀\n\n#Harrymack #Freestyle #Drums\n\nCOME SEE ME ON TOUR:\nhttps://www.harrymackofficial.com/shows\n\nJOIN THE PATREON FAMILY:\nhttp://patreon.com/harrymack\n\nJOIN MY DISCORD:\nhttps://discord.gg/8yXRxbF\n\nSHOP MY MERCH:\nhttps://shop.harrymackofficial.com\n\nHARRY MACK CLIPS CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnAEyz9VnlBL1DiQqliJkQ\n\nWANT TO BE A SPONSOR?\npartnerships@harrymackofficial.com\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIALS:\nTikTok: http://tiktok.com/@harrymackofficial\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/harrymack\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/harrymack\nTwitch: https://twitch.tv/harrymackofficial\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/harrymack",

I’ve been blessed to connect with so many inspiring people, whether it was on Omegle, Happy Hour, Guerrilla Bars, or at the live shows. It’s truly been an honor 🙏🏻 I’m very excited for everything that’s coming in 2022, but before we get there… you KNOW I gotta hit y’all with an EPIC highlight video. So here it is folks: The Best Of 2021 🏆\n\nThis thing is over 8 hours long (I know, I know, it’s a little ridiculous…) but the truth is there were just too many quality moments to choose from. If any one of y’all makes it from beginning to end in one-sitting, please let me know in the comments so you can claim your 50,000 Mack-Points (not a real thing) 😂 Again, thank you all so much for the support. I wouldn’t be able to exist as an independent artist without this amazing community. We are building something really special together, and as hard as we went in 2021, I can guarantee you I’m only gonna work harder this coming year to give you all the best content I possibly can- you definitely deserve it.

      "description": "I’ve always been someone who’s fascinated by PROCESS, especially when it comes to music and art. Learning that Nas did the entire first verse of “NY State of Mind” in one take with his whole crew in the booth with him, or that Slum Village laid all the vocals for “Fan-Tas-Tic (Volume 1)” to a click track and then Dilla created the beats after the fact (what???? ), or that Bill Withers’ band grooved on “Use Me” for 10 minutes straight in the studio before Bill laid his vocals (so that what we hear as the downbeat of the album track is actually preceded by a long stretch of hypnotic grooving that went straight to the cutting room floor… there’s one way to make sure the pocket is deep right from the “first notes”)… this is the type of stuff that really gets me fired up.\n\nFor myself as a rapper, PROCESS has always been a huge part of my story. Freestyling off-top is all about improvising new lyrics in the spur of the moment. Fans of Freestyle Rappers are typically less interested in hearing them recite their pre-existing lyrics verbatim, and much more excited to watch the PROCESS unfold as the emcee cooks up brand new lyrics in the moment, based on their mood, the latest article they read, the vibe of the beat, the energy in the room, visual stimuli, or the topic suggestion they’ve just been given. “Freestyling” quite literally describes a PROCESS, and thus a Freestyle Rapper is someone known for their mastery of a particular PROCESS. \n\nWith this project, I wanted to experiment with a few different PROCESSES to challenge myself creatively and see what emotions/vibes I could channel. The first 2 songs are extremely raw and vulnerable, the last song is much more polished. I think both approaches have merit and can lead to interesting results. In general, it’s much scarier to release music that isn’t based on someone else’s words (a la Omegle Bars) because I don’t have that safety net of saying “oh yeah, well I just rapped about that because they asked me to.” But as I say in the last song: “my theory is embrace fear”, so that’s what I’ve done in deciding to release these tracks out into the wild. I hope you enjoy, and I’m super curious to hear which PROCESS yielded the most enjoyable results for you as a listener- let me know in the comments.\n\nMuch love!\nMack \n\n#HarryMack #Freestyle #SOULilloquies\n\nINSTRUMENTALS\n1) 'Blood, Sweat, and Tears' (Prod.

We started at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas where I can be seen warming up the stage for a famous r&b singer we’re all very familiar with (no spoilers!! — this is also the one and only opportunity to see me rapping alongside go-go dancers, so that’s fun 😂). Next we took it to the LEGENDARY San Jose Improv - a stage that’s been graced by the likes of Harry Houdini & Charlie Chaplin - where I performed for the hypest audience I’ve ever had the pleasure to rock for (shout out to The Bay, y’all are my heart ❤️). Lastly we did some dope pop-up performances at SF Ski Fest (and we mayyyy have even found some time to sneak in a bayside Guerrilla Bars shoot for good measure). After this little run, I’m more fired up than ever to do more out-of-town shows in the coming year.

These shows are particularly special to me because they represent my first public foray into rocking a full set off the top without anything written or prepared ahead of time. Come take a peek at what goes into prepping for, and executing, a fully improvised hip-hop experience. Shout out to all the hype people who came out to rock with us in LA and Irvine. Y’all are amazing 🙏🏻 Also shout out to @surjazz and my whole team for holding me down and making these shows a reality. We’re working hard to bring the Energy Exchange to more cities, so let me know where y’all wanna see me rock next 🚀✨\n\n#HarryMack #Freestyle #HipHop\n\n\nJOIN THE PATREON FAMILY\nhttp://patreon.com/harrymack\n\nJOIN MY DISCORD:\nhttps://discord.gg/8yXRxbF\n\nSHOP MY MERCH\nhttps://shop.harrymackofficial.com\n\nHARRY MACK CLIPS CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnAEyz9VnlBL1DiQqliJkQ\n\nWANT TO BE A SPONSOR?\npartnerships@harrymackofficial.com\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIALS \nhttps://twitch.tv/harrymackofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/harrymack\nhttps://www.facebook.com/harrymack\nhttps://twitter.com/harrymack\nhttp://tiktok.com/@harrymackofficial",

We try and find ways to die random deaths that are selected after each round. We have five minutes to find out how to die the way that was chosen before we lose. Me and my friend George both get different random deaths, and whoever loses first loses the game.\n\nThis is a little different than my normal content. Rather than being about combat or about trapping, this is about racing and about general Minecraft skills. This was super fun, challenging, and pretty funny overall.\n\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises.",

People confuse them sometimes, as that run is not counted towards the leaderboard and the runs on my Youtube all were. Any records on my Youtube were beaten a long time ago though! Really awesome for memories sake :) I don't speedrun competitively anymore, and the records you'll see on my channel were before speedrunning Minecraft competitively was a huge thing, so don't take these half decent times too seriously!\n\nI had a lot of fun, but also a lot of headaches when trying to beat this record. I almost stopped trying multiple times, but I had my friends to encourage me to keep going. Was an amazing moment that they got to be there for me.\n\nMAJOR props to realbenex for his amazing time. I saw it midway through attempting this record, and almost gave up because it was such a great run.\n\nPrevious WR was 22:18 by realbenex @Benex\n\nVersion: 1.15.2\nSeed: -8838743941849800027\nDifficulty: Normal",

We are having an epic battle, a race to see who can eat the most the fastest!! There are many different flavors of Indomie Mi Goreng ramen, this is our favorite. You can get the super spicy version too, but don't worry, it's not as spicy as the Nuclear Fire Noodle challenge or any of those korean fire noodles ASMR videos you see on Youtube. This is VERY delicious and the PERFECT amount of spice level for us. We are eating like 20 packs of these or something crazy. \n\nCandy (Hungry Fat Chick) is one of my favorite people in the world and we've done tons of collabs over on her channel. Make sure you go watch them! Here's a link to our newest collab on her channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV9IlNoTInk",

As ya'll know, I've been separated from my ex husband Orlin Home for 2 months now, and we are in the filing process of the divorce. I packed my bags and moved to Las Vegas, a place I have always enjoyed for the food and company. I've been very fortunate and blessed, especially in 2020, despite the hardships in my marriage, from creating my new Mukbang channel called \"More Nikocado\" as well as monetizing myself on a few other platforms outside of YouTube. I truly owe this new home to all of you. This condo rests near the Las Vegas strip and was on the market for only a few months before I was able to purchase it back in January of 2021. If you may recall, my daily mukbang videos involved lots of hints of \"a big surprise is coming but I can't tell you yet\" type of stuff. Down below me is hotel, casino and spa. I'm so close to all of my favorite foods and the building has great security, which is why I feel comfortable publishing my location like this. I'm excited, nervous, and sad to start this new chapter, as I'm leaving behind somebody who I thought would be in my life forever. It's bittersweet. I hope you enjoy my house tour. I've filmed a few mukbangs in here already, too. You can find them on my More Nikocado channel or by clicking here if ya want to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eymE18Fa9Uo&list=PLs5NFD_oMEXzOkUM25X0pKkOgnJLQvWGD",

Each culture will add its own special gameplay layer, leading to near-endless outcomes.\n\nMORE THAN HISTORY, IT’S YOUR STORY\n\nFace historical events, take impactful moral decisions, and make scientific breakthroughs. Discover the natural wonders of the world or build the most remarkable creations of humankind. Each game element is historically authentic. Combine them to build your own vision of the world.\n\nLEAVE YOUR MARK ON THE WORLD\n\nThe journey matters more than destination. Fame is a new and unifying victory condition. Every great deed you accomplish, every moral choice you make, every battle won will build your fame and leave a lasting impact on the world. The player with the most fame will win the game. Will you be the one to leave the deepest mark on the world?\n\nMASTER TACTICAL BATTLES ON LAND, SEA & AIR\n\nEach battle in HUMANKIND™ plays out like a mini turn-based board game on top of the actual world map. Unstack your armies and command each of your units, including the emblematic units of your culture and their special abilities. Construct siege weapons to besiege and occupy cities. Fight in large battles spanning multiple turns, and don’t hesitate to bring in reinforcements!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LEADER\n\nIn HUMANKIND™, you’ll be playing the leader of your society as an avatar that you create and customize! Your avatar will evolve visually over the course of the game as your civilization develops. You’ll also be able to level up your leader via a meta-progression system to unlock custom looks that you can showoff to strangers and friends alike in multiplayer matches up to 8 players.\n\nHOW FAR WILL YOU PUSH HUMANKIND?",

Play alone or team up in online co-op. Explore the streets of Praslav, scavenge for food and supplies, beg, steal, and do whatever else it takes to survive the forthcoming winter.\n\nWelcome to Praslav, a cold Central European city that grows even colder with the coming winter. Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades.\n\nWhile most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the streets with nowhere to go.\n\nYou are one of those people.\n\nKeep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways - staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point.\n\nHow far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely outweigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are.\n\nSpend the last few days of autumn wisely – gather supplies, equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty - every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again.\n\nUnlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav.\n\nMaybe there is no warm apartment waiting for you at the end of the day, but you do not have to keep sleeping on park benches either. Find a suitable place and get to work. Construct walls and roofs to shield you from the elements. Gather discarded furniture and curios to furnish your hideout and make it truly your own.\n\nIs surviving on your own too difficult? Get the gang together. The game supports online co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. Play alone, together with your friends, or even with total strangers. Team up, collect resources, build a shanty town, survive the winter.\n\nFor over a decade, no one has been able to bring the many factions of the homeless together. The throne of the Homeless King has been sitting empty for far too long. Who will earn enough respect and prove themselves worthy of uniting the homeless? Will you rise to the occasion?",

I created this game in my video: \"I Made Squid Game, But it's a Multiplayer Game\", and called it Crab Game. But Crab Game got millions of downloads (10m at the time of writing this), and now netflix might be out to get me, so i have to update crab game and make it different, so netflix doesnt destroy me for copying squid game. haha cool\n\n//about\nHey!

It ended up being not the best idea ever, and theres even this thing called google cardboard vr, so google straight copied me, but its fine, as long as google accepts my boxing match invitation. Anyway in the next episode we'll make a proper vr headset with arms, so i dont have to use my face to scream with, cuz thats kinda hard. Making a vr headset and vr games was fun tho, and ill probably get my hands on a real vr headset soon, maybe the valve index or like the oculus rift s or maybe just the oculus quest. all the games are made with unity btw, but i didnt use the vr support cuz im dumb lol. anyway thanks for watching and why are you reading this? you know this is just metadata right get outta here kiddo before i slamdunk\n\nAnyway would you wanna see me make a proper vr game with a proper vr headset? could be fun, and i think its pretty easy to make vr games with unity, so ill probbaly do it gamers\n\nAlso if you wanna try this for yourself, there are many video on youtube actually, like \"how to make virtual reality cardboard headset\" or something like that, and usually they make vr headsets from stuff you can find in your home, so its something to try out. tho obviously if you have some milk cartons lying around, i recommend you try building the oculus milk, as its an absolute unstoppable machine\n\n//about\nHey!

Pulling all the commens from accross my channel, and then finding my top 10.000 fans / top 10k commenters on my channel. Then I build a game where a bunch of cubes fight eacother, and finally load the comments into the players. Then all the players will get stats in the battle royale game, depending on how many comments they have on my channel. The game runs fine with 10,000 players, and could probably even do more. \nHope you enjoy this weird idea, I have some ideas for similar stuff as well, so make sure you slap subscribe.\nAlso thanks for the crazy response on my video \"He said I Couldn't Make a 3D Game...

For the first part of the game, I will focus on making a bunch of minigames you play with your friends, or bots if you dont have any friends like me haha anyway all the previous progress is definitely not lost. I'm probably going to add parts of it as their own minigames later on. And even if I don't, I will still take with me all the experience from previously developing, as seen in the devlogs. \nHopefully this way, development should be much quicker, and I might actually be able to release it sometime in 2020, but I'm not too sure on the date yet, as I'm still working on a lot of planning, and i also have a ton of other game / video ideas. \nAnyway, thanks for sticking around, this is gonne be sick\n\n\n//about\nHey!

Spoilers below 👇🏻 \n\n.\n.\n.\nThe violin in question is a 3/4 violin that the boy’s mom said he had grown out of and needed a new one. She said he didn’t have any particular attachment to it, but he was worried he would get in trouble because of what happened in class. His teacher assured him his parents knew and that he could keep the brand new, much better full-size violin. I got photos with him and signed his old violin afterward, and his parents approved him appearing in this video as well. I recently checked with Caleb’s teacher and he’s doing great! 🎻 \n\nMore about me: https://linktr.ee/roblandes\n\nI pranked two high school orchestras by pretending to be a terrible substitute teacher.

As mentioned in the video, they claim no conflict of interest but some of the funding does ultimately come from the radon therapy industry.\n\nThere are a LOT of papers about this, and about radiation hormesis.

I was in the area, so I stopped by, and found that things might be changing soon.\n\nREFERENCES:\nManchester Ship Canal Act (1885)\nRixton and Warburton Bridge Act (1863)\n(NOTE: it looks like permission for the toll bridge was set up by the 1863 Act, but that was a different bridge over the River Mersey, and the laws and permissions were transferred over to the Ship Canal when they needed a bigger bridge and it is a complete mess of legal wrangling.

Spread further than you want to compensate for contractions.

Congratulations, you're at the point of no return. \n\nUndoh's on 425 (fourtwentyfundoh). Throw the pizza in for 10-14 minutes. Don't literally throw it as that will create a mess. Keep an eye on it.

It seems obvious but it's so easy to forget. Either turn the handle toward the back of your stovetop or put your glove on it as a reminder. Burnt hands do not feel good. \n\nAND NOW WAIT!! Here's the thing. When you order pizza delivery it's been cooling down in the box for a while. The pizza coming out of the onion is super fucking hot. Don't eat it right away. Practice some restraint for once in your life. Leave it for a good ten minutes to avoid burning the roof of your mouth. Clean the kitchen or something. Just don't eat that pizza or you will be in a world of pain. I know from experience because I'm a dumbass.",

Don't be a maverick and make it 116. \n\n2.5 teaspoons of instant yeast added to the milk \n1 teaspoon of sugar added to the milk \nAnd rustle that around a bit, also known as agitation \n\nWait around ten minutes for the yeast to foam up like a mad dog. If it doesn't foam your yeast is dead, just like your bedroom during the pandemic \n\n2 tablespoons of just melted butter - add that in \n¼ cup of sugar - add that in and wangjangle \n\n1 large egg - warm it up in some water then crack it in and wangjangle \n\n2.5 cups of flour - put it in a medium or large bowl \n1 teaspoon salt - add that in and sift together \n\nNow you're going to add the dry stuff to the wet stuff. Move the wet stuff to a bigger bowl of necessary. Add small bits of flower and wangjangle until your whisk can no longer handle it, then use something more stiff. Eventually you'll have a gloopy ball of dough and then you can get enough flour in there so it's not too sticky and transfer it to a surface with some more flour. Keep adding flour until you have a nice ball of dough that's not extremely dry but also not sticky. I used a bit less than the amount of flour I mentioned, but feel it out. \n\nKnead that for 8 to ten minutes, and drop a few elbows and take out some of that pent up aggression, and pretend you're in a 'practical movement' class. \n\nNow put some oil or slippery chemical spray in a bowl and add the dough ball and put some of oil/spray on top, cover with cling wrap or a damp cloth and let it expand for an hour \n\nRoll it out into a big rectangle that's around ¼ inch thick, I went a bit thinner \n\nSpread 1 to 2 tablespoons of cinnamon glue, aka softened butter, across the surface \n\nFILLING\n1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon \n⅔ cup brown sugar \n1 teaspoon vanilla extract \nMix those together in a bowl, then sprinkle and smoothen all over the dough with your steam roller \n\nRoll the dough toward you until you struggle with your emotions then feel free to push it away from you \n\nSlice up the dough into 10 to 12 rolls using a wicked shawp knife or dental floss \n\nSpray a pan or put down some parchment paper (you can glue it with oil so it sticks) and place the rolls inside with a bit of space but not too much. I put too much space between mine...then should end up touching to help lock the moisture between them. \n\nCover with cling wrap and let them expand for an hour to an hour and a half. \n\nBaste with some more butter as though you an artist who's work only becomes known when your brother's wife spends years curating exhibitions of your work after your death. \n\nUndoh's on 350 and they can go in for 20 minutes or maybe a bit less...I felt those were a bit overcooked. Keep an eye on it and take them out when you think they're done and about as soft or firm as you like \n\nFROSTING\n\n¾ cup cream choose at room temp \n4 tablespoons butter \n1.5 cups of powdered sugar \nMix the cream cheese and butter together first and then wangjanlge in the powdered sugar a bit at a time \nOh yeah, then add a pinch of salt and half a teaspoon of vanilla extract if you feel like it.

      "title": "Perfect Scrambled Eggs with Ricotta and Chives (episode 125)",
      "description": "When I first had scrambled eggs with ricotta and chives at a local restaurant I thought I had died and gone to egg heaven! The taste was so perfect, but the texture was just divine. I knew I had to come up with my own recipe to recreate this scrambled egg masterpiece. \n\nThese eggs reminded me so much of being in France. And if there’s one thing the French know, it’s how to make eggs; trust me on this one! \n\nWhen I went to purchase the eggs to make this recipe they didn’t have the organic eggs I normally buy. I thought about getting the free range eggs but they’re honestly just not the same. A lot of marketing goes into those egg labels but everyone knows that organic is always best. I ended up walking 7 minutes to another store to find the organic ones, and boy was it well worth it. Plus I burned of some extra calories which really revved up my appetite! \n\nI harvested the chives from a friends herb garden. I’m sure going to owe her one! I guess I’m gonna have to make her one of those mimosas ;) \n\nAlright, well let’s get to it. The recipe: \n\n3 organic eggs \nFresh chives \nFresh ricotta cheese \nSalted organic butter \nSalt and pepper to taste \n\nFinely chop the chives until you have around a tablespoon or so. Remember this doesn’t have to be perfect! I end up putting in a different amount every time.\n\nCrack three eggs into a bowl and whisk. Feel free to add in some salt and don’t let anyone tell you it makes the eggs tough or watery! Salt breaks down protein and if anything it will make them just slightly more tender. \n\nHeat your pan to medium low. Be patient with this. Add in some butter (not too much!) then pour in your eggs. \n\nScrape the bottom of the pan with your silicone spatula until the eggs are almost set, just a bit undercooked. \n\nStir in two tablespoons or so of fresh ricotta cheese, and remove the pan from the heat.\n\nSpoon the eggs onto some delicious whole grain toast and serve with fruit of choice. The contract in texture between the crunch toast and the soft eggs is to die for. \n\nNow that’s what I call perfect scrambled eggs :) \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin",

      "title": "Onion Rings (episode 124)",
      "description": "Thank you to Bushmills Whiskey for sponsoring this video  http://www.inflcr.co/SH6HK\n\nDeep fried onion rings are one of the best edible hoops in existence. Onion rings are far better than apple rings, carrot rings, and also rings. \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\nhttp://yousuckatcooking.com\n\nBefore we get into the recipe, let's talk safety. A hot pot full of oil is super dangerous. You can deep fry safely but you have to know what you're doing. The first time I tried it, I was dipping my meat thermometer in the oil to keep track of the temperature. This was colossally stupid. You need a dedicated thermometer on your pot so you can watch constantly and so you won't drop it inside. Better yet, a dedicated deep fryer is really the way to go, and you can just read the instruction manual. Long story short, if your oil temperature gets out of control a fire can start, and you can't put it out with water, you either have to smother it or use a fire extinguisher. Also, the oil takes FOREVER to cool down, so many sure anyone in your house knows not to touch it when you're done using it. It also takes FOREVER to heat up so it's super tempting to turn up the temperature, which is a mistake (on my stovetop, 350 F was just below the number 4. Anyway, read this guide if you think you actually want to try deep frying, and then just order onion rings from the bar instead. \n\nDeep Fry Safety \nhttps://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-deep-fry-safely\n\nRecipe \n\nSlice some onions and make rings\nRemove tape\nYeah basically take any onion you like \nAdd ¾ cup of flour and ¼ cup corn starch to a bowl \nThen add spices; cayenne, chilli powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, whatever. Let's say around a tablespoon total \nAdd around a cup of soda water, more or less, depending on how buck wild you've gone with the spices. One description I read about the thickness is that it should be like thick paint. \n\nHeat 3 or so inches of peanut oil to 350 degrees F in a tall sturdy pot (not non stick)\nPreferably on your back burner so it won't get knocked. If your vessel has handles, make sure they are not sticking out \nI see a lot of people use their fingers to put things into the oil. I don't like this method because that's too close for comfort. The spider strainer, in my opinion, is the best way to go. The chance of dropping something in the oil is very minimal. If you're going to use tongs, grip tightly, and I don't recommend silicon tipped tongs because they are slippery. You REALLY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE AN OIIL SPLASH \nSo use your spider strainer to lower an undoh ring into the oil\nAfter a minute or a minute and a half, flip it, then take it out after another minute. Just trust your eyes in terms of how cooked you want it \nI highly recommend setting a timer each time you put a batch in as it's easy to get distracted for one minute and you really have to have your head in the game for as long as you are deep frying \nPlace onion rings on a wire rack with paper towels underneath. If you don't have a wire rack you can place them on paper towels on a plate or in a bowl \nWhen you're all done, move that oil to the back burner if it's not already there (very, very carefully, using oven mitts), and make sure everyone knows not to touch it for a couple hours. Keep your thermometer in there so you know when it's completely cooled\nThen you can either save it or dispose of it. Here's a helpful guide on how to dispose of the oil...long story short, it will end up in the trash, not the sink or toilet \nhttps://www.thespruceeats.com/how-do-i-dispose-of-used-cooking-oil-908995\n\nThanks! I hope you order onion rings from the bar.",

I did one where all I added was maple syrup and that was interesting although you can barely taste the maple over the powdered sugar, but what I learned from this is holy cow does corn syrup ever taste good. As an adult I've been in this mentality that corn syrup is the worst and why would you ever eat that and I tasted it for the first time in years and it was like eating caramel for the first time. I think I chugged that stuff when I was a kid and wanted candy because it's liquid candy. Anyway, what I'm saying is I recommend corn syrup. Even though it comes from corn, which is not recommended.",
