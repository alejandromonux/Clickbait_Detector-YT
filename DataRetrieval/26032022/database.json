If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars, at just 0.1% of the speed of light, It could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years. Which is not that long given the billions of years the milky way has existed \u2013 so in principle any spacefaring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy. And yet we see nothing, hear nothing, the universe seems empty. Devoid of others. This is the Fermi Paradox, which we have discussed in more detail in other videos.\n\nConfronted with the seemingly empty universe, humanity faces a dilemma. We desperately want to know if we are alone in the Milky Way. We want to call out and reveal ourselves to anyone watching but that could be the last thing we ever do.

Every living thing has to solve this problem and the solution is surprisingly different depending on one of the most important regulators of life: Size.\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeES\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with \u2764 from https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army \ud83d\udc27 https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC \u266c\u266a\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\n\nSoundcloud:   https://bit.ly/36hTooO\nBandcamp:     https://bit.ly/38jHFJb \n\n\ud83d\udc26\ud83d\udc27\ud83d\udc24 PATREON BIRD ARMY \ud83d\udc24\ud83d\udc27\ud83d\udc26\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons from http://kgs.link/patreon who support us every month and made this video possible:\n\nVincent Mascio, Gabriel Sucia, \u0410\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043c \u042f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, Thomas Hradek, Nebual, Rodrigo Espinosa, Jacobo Loewen, Kirsten Mann, Matias Altalef, Renato Vass\u00e3o, triger traiger, Richard Decal, SmokinBuddha, R D, William Lucca, John Teeslink, Yrjosmiel, Tomasz Stachowiak, WE1RD, ScorchedShadow, Zach Knibbs, jrinehimer, Michael, Conner Boltz, Sidong Fu, Jake Kish, Caeruleus, Gleb Radchenko, Kieren Quinn, Augustine, Che Tao, Biken Gurung, Adelina Bakieva, Alex Ellis, Trevor Shackelford, Graham Gersdorff, Aditya Taday, Chaitali Sura, Rhys Clark, Trymian Cassidy, Anton Vietrov, Samuel Blanchard, libor riska, Julia VS, Stoney Bair, Nika Chkhartishvili, Erwin Ritua, Nicholas Roth, Mark Pickenheim, Haaxor1689, Niklas, Sean K Reynolds, Mark Gubatan, Caleb Biasco, MoeMoep, Edmund Sang Fontaine, Silquetoast, Randy Cully, Joseph Schadler, Matt Cameron, x yxy, Elie & Mary-Anne, Alaina Kramer, Memes, Dragon's Demize, Caleb Whitaker, KushrenadaT, Andrei, Daniel Suzuki, Jett Thomas, Laszlo Steinhoff, Alexander Brown, Braden Culbert, Sarah, Corey Austen, Gosia Rychlik, \u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432, Neo Martin, Anonimas, Nicolas Sepulveda, Nicole de Vries, Maryam Sheybanifard, John Forbes, ertojo, Zaten the Changeling, Dmytro Haranzha, Matt Clarkson, G Crockett, Brennen Schott, Mirek Novak, Pedro Lozano, Oskar Syahbana, Robin, Porky Hontas, Sebastien J, Eileen Kirschner, Peyton Groshart, Martin, Jan Ryklikas, Dr. Daniel Lehmann, Le plus Luc de tous les Luc, yeapea [Andi], Ansgar Rust, Jan Karsten, Hichem Moussa VoulezVouloz, Morbeyn, Sjoerd Smit, Julian Hiorns, The Wanton Dogfish, Alice Whiteway, Jordan Lake, Whitney Warren, Moses Holmstr\u00f6m, Morgan", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Inside the Lab: Robotics After Hours", "description": "What do our robots really get up to after hours?

The inspection robot was equipped with both a high-resolution 30X optical zoom pan/tilt/zoom camera and an infrared (IR) thermal camera to detect signs of potential problems.\n\nA top priority at the facility is the monitoring of equipment conditions. Because the valve hall is water-cooled, any leaks could cause issues leading to equipment overheating and malfunction. While stationary cameras could detect signs of water leaks in certain locations, there\u2019s no way for those cameras to cover every angle of the valve hall.\n\nWith the optical zoom camera, Spot was able to inspect the equipment during operation.

Nothing happened.\n\n\"...HOW DO YOU MESS UP A CLICK?!?!\"\n ZeroLenny\u2122 ranted as he shoved Impostor Lenny off the computer and begun to press the \"Purchase Now!\" button roughly 142,784,920,915 time a second.\n\n\"Lenny, I-I think the websites overloaded with orders w-we can't get in...\"\nImpostor Lenny snatched the champagne bottle from ZeroLenny\u2122's defeated, cold hands and begun downing it with a vicious death-wish like speed.\n\n\"B-BUT HOW?!?!?! HOW DID SONY NOT KNOW THIS WOULD HAPPEN??????\"\n ZeroLenny\u2122 was livid, ready to punch the computer screen clean through... \n\nAll of sudden, the computer loaded to the Checkout Cart screen, exclaiming \"PS5 ready in stock to order!\"\n\n\"HOLY HOT MOTHER OF SPICE THIS IS IT!!!!\"\n ZeroLenny\u2122 started punching the click button on his mouse repeatedly, smashing his desk into a mangled wooden wreck.\n\nThe computer screen loaded into a new page.\n\nSorry! We are out of stock! We have just had 500 purchases from \"Big Gwyn the Scalper Better luck next time you massive Wet Wipes xoxo!\n\nThe two sat there in pure silence. A rather new emotion overcame them both which could only be described as a mix of unyielding rage and pure malice.

How long have you been working on this?!\"\n\nIt's been a long week for the two Lennys. Not a second had gone by after returning from Weeboo Island when they were informed about the death of one of their closest friends \"Big Gazza\". The two worked tirelessly organizing the biggest funeral party known to Lordran and the deadline was rapidly approaching. However not all was lost, while Impostor Lenny worked day and night on the funeral, ZeroLenny\u2122 worked in secret on yet another one of his infamous projects. The day of the funeral was finally here, and while Impostor Lenny was ready to report to ZeroLenny\u2122 that he had done absolutely nothing, he gazed upon a most glorious sight; The Official ZeroLenny\u2122 bar!\n\n\"Ah, there you are!\"\nZeroLenny\u2122 jumped down from the crudely fastened bar table. He seemed rather proud of the random amalgamation of wood and nail. Many would say it wasn't a bar but if you would narrow your eyes very tightly, you would see that it may resemble a bar! Complete with a pub sign!\n\n\"L-Lenny it's absolutely perfect! Look at that! You've even got a Bar sign!\"\nImpostor Lenny squinted fondly at the sign. \n\"...Leenies Bra?... Now have you spelt that right?\"\n\n\"I haven't a clue I'm too drunk to read. Anyway how's the funeral going?\n\n\"Well what can I say Lenny it's been an absolute disaster!\"\nImpostor Lenny sat down at a bar stood; the rotted Undead Burg wood almost snapping instantly on impact.\n\"To be honest with you Lenny, I've done nothing....\"\n\n\"Aah well it doesn't matter! Now we've got this old baby!\"\nZeroLenny\u2122 patted his drinks holder, clanging the various bottles into another.\n\n\"So then me old matey! First drinks on me! What are we having!\"\n\nImpostor Lenny almost flinched.\n\n\"Y-you're buying me a drink?! W-well in that case I'll just have the house special!\"\nImpostor Lenny tried to hide the warm grin on his face, thinking that he had finally made a friend for the first time in his life.\n\n\"Right! Here you go!\"\nZeroLenny\u2122 slammed down two pints of a foul, bubbling liquid.\n\n\"Now drink up quick! Or it'll melt straight through the glass!\"\nZeroLenny\u2122 downed the pint without hesitation and begun pouring another.\n\n\"...How did Big Gazza even die anyway?\"\nImpostor Lenny took his pint and started to stagger around the Undead Burg Square, he seemed to be drunk off the fumes of the drink.\n\n\"Undead Burg Dog Tetanus.\"\nZeroLenny\u2122 poured another, he was well into his 4th.\n\n\"Aaaaah who cares! Hey this drink is great it's getting me all riled up for some good old fashioned YouTube Friendly Guideline swearing! H-HOW MANY HAVE I HAD?!?!\"\n\nZeroLenny\u2122 took a quick glance at Impostor Lenny, he was absolutely trashed, then he looked at his pint glass.\n\n\"...N-....None.\"\n\n\"YEAAH THIS IS THE LIFE, ISN'T IT?!?!\"\nImpostor Lenny slumped down against the front of the bar.\n\n\"Unfortunately yes I can't quite seem to block it out.\"\n\n\"Yeaaa you're right! these funerals get boring aren't they?!\"\n\n\"..... Nah.\"\nZeroLenny\u2122 stopped pouring his 8th pint and began sipping it casually.\n\"Just you wait, it'll pick up soon... A fight usually breaks out.\n\n\"D-does it?\"\nImpostor lenny gulped.\n\n\"Oh yeah.\"\nZeroLenny\u2122 glanced around the Undead Burg Square, they were the only two there.\n\n\"You know... Someone will make an innocent remark, it'll be misinterpreted from the other... the insults will start to fly and there'll be faults on both sides.... someone won't leave it!\"\nZeroLenny\u2122 clenched his fist dramatically as he continued\n\n\"Drink fuelled emotions will run high! Blows will be thrown!\"\nZeroLenny\u2122 smirked at Impostor Lenny. \".... Mine will connect.\"\n\nImpostor Lenny started shaking nervously as he began to catch on. \nZeroLenny\u2122 continued.\n\n\"Someone calls the Undead Burg Police! And we all wake up in Anor Londo with blood on our hands....\"\nZeroLenny\u2122 started drinking his pint again.\n\n\"B-blimey... Sounds a big rough.\"\nImpostor Lenny sheepishly whispered under his breath.\n\nZeroLenny\u2122 smashed his pint against the table.\n\"ARE YOU STARTING THEN BIG MAN?!?!?!\"\n\nZeroLenny\u2122 tore up his bar table wooden planks and smashed them violently against Impostor Lenny's face. Thus beginning another Lenny fight.\n\nThis is what happened after.\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nfam \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 you've taken \ud83d\udebb that \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4dlike button\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d on three \u2b06\u2197\u27a1 dates \ud83c\udfdd\ud83c\udf71\ud83d\udeb2 now...

Today I thought I\u2019d show you how to make some traditional Japanese sweets which we call WAGASHI in Japanese. \n\nToday I\u2019m going to show you how to make KINAKO powder - which is used in a lot of sweets and is made from roasted dried soy beans! It has a really warm and nutty flavor and can be used for a variety of different sweets!\n\nI\u2019ll also show you probably the most SIMPLE sweet you can make with Kinako - there\u2019s only 2 ingredients! \n\n00:00 Intro\n00:44 A Word from our Sponsor!\n01:36 Making Kinako Powder\n04:45 Making Easy Kinako Sweets \n08:22 Let\u2019s Eat!\n10:25 Get Sweets with Tokyo Treat and Sakuraco\n\nIngredients (serves 3):\nKinako Powder:\n- 100g of Dried Soybeans \n\nKinako Sweets \n- 30g of either honey, condensed milk OR brown sugar syrup \n\n- If you don\u2019t buy kinako powder premade you can make it using dried soy beans, add 100g of soybeans to a frying pan and cook over a low heat for 30 minutes. Make sure none of the beans stack on top of each other and occasionally stir them around. (Don\u2019t let them brown!)\n- Once you see all the beans begin to crack, set them aside and leave them to cool - you can leave them at room temp or chill them in the fridge \n- Once your beans are cooled, add them bit by bit into a grinder and grind them into a fine powder - you may need to run the powder again through a fine sieve and then grind any remaining large chunks one more time\n- To make the yori-kinako sweets you will need to choose your sweet liquid - either honey, brown sugar syrup or condensed milk are good choices. Whatever you choose you will want to microwave on high for about 15 seconds to make the liquid runny\n- Take 30g of your kinako powder and mix with your liquid of choice - mix well until your kinako is sticky and the texture of wet sand \n(Make sure to keep some of your powder for later!)\n- Put this mixture in either plastic wrap or a ziplock bag and shape into a rectangle and until all the edges are smooth\n- Let that mixture sit in the fridge for 10-20 minutes\n- Once your mixture has sat and chilled, take it out and cut into smaller 2cm thick rectangles - you may want to wet your knife with water before you do this to prevent sticking \n- Take your now solid kinako rectangles and cover them in kinako powder, grab the ends and twist into a nice spiral shape\n- Serve with tea and enjoy!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Make PERFECT Fluffy OMURICE at Home | Japanese Omelet Rice", "description": "Check out my brand new TWITTER:\nhttps://twitter.com/ChampRyosuke\n\nHey guys! I\u2019ve had a lot of requests for this dish - Japanese OMURICE or omelet served over flavored chicken rice! \n\nThis can be quite a hard one to master but the basics of the dish are very simple! Try it at home!\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:36 Preparing the Flavored Chicken Rice\n04:13 Preparing the Sauce\n04:58 Making the Omelet\n08:16 Let\u2019s Eat!\n\nIngredients (serves 3):\n\nFlavored Chicken Rice :\n\n- 100g chicken tender (or breast/thigh)\n- \u00bd diced onion \n- \u00bc diced carrot\n- 1 diced shiitake mushroom (or other mushroom)\n- 160g cooked rice \n- 2 tbsp ketchup\n- salt/pepper to taste\n\nOmelet:\n\n- 3 Large Eggs\n- 1tbsp water (you can replace with milk/soy milk)\n- pinch of salt \n\nFor Sauce\n- 1 tbsp of water\n- 1 tbsp ketchup\n- 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce \n- 10g butter\n\nHow to Make:\n\n- Start by preparing your flavored chicken rice. Cut up 100g of chicken tenders (breast or thigh is fine too) into small chunks. If you use tenders you can remove the white sinew part by holding down the chicken with a knife or fork and pulling it out.\n- Dice \u00bd an onion, \u00bc carrot and 1 shiitake mushroom into small pieces \n- Add olive oil to a frying pan and heat to a medium heat - cook your chicken for a few seconds when the pan is heated and then add the vegetables \n- Add 160g of rice and 2 tbsp of ketchup and give it a good stir. Cook for a few minutes until everything is cooked through and then add salt (and pepper) to taste\n- Now if you want a nice round shape for your omurice - transfer your rice to a small bowl, press down on the top with a spatula and then transfer onto your final plate by placing the bowl upside down\n- For the omurice sauce add 1 tbsp of water to a frying pan over a low heat then add 1 tbsp of ketchup and worcestershire sauce and turn up the heat while mixing\n- Add the butter and keep mixing until all the butter is melted and the sauce has turned nice and silky - transfer to a small bowl for later \n- In a mixing bowl, crack 3 large eggs, add 1 tbsp of water (milk/soy milk is okay but it may give you a milder taste) and a pinch of salt\n- Give your mixture a whisk but make sure not to lift the whisk from the mixture - this will prevent air from entering into the omelet mix\n- Now in a small frying pan (20cm) add olive oil and heat to a medium-high, to check if the pan is hot enough - dip chopsticks into the mixture and try cooking a small amount\n- Once the pan is heated, add your egg mixture and keep stirring with chopsticks from the outside of the pan inward \n- Once you start to see the middle of the omelet begin to cook and the outsides begin to set, take the pan off the heat and start folding the omelet away from you into the middle, use your chopsticks to adjust the shape if necessary\n- Wait for a few seconds and then flip the omelet once, let it cook for a few more seconds so the underside can cook and your omelet is done!\n- Place over your chicken rice and cut open - your omelet should fold out over the rice and be nice and fluffy while still being a tiny bit runny - pour your sauce over and enjoy!", "rating": 2}, {"title": "How to make SUSHI at Home | Negitoro Sushi (Tuna & Salmon)", "description": "Hey guys! Sorry for the long wait for this video but I\u2019ve been working on some new and exciting things for the channel so make sure to be on the lookout!\n\nToday we\u2019re making a simple type of sushi that you guys can make at home - it\u2019s called NEGITORO - and is traditionally diced fatty Tuna and green onion that can be served as a sushi roll or on a bowl of rice. I know some people may find it hard to get Tuna though - so I\u2019ve made a version with Salmon as well! \n\nSo that\u2019s THREE types of easy sushi! Tuna Rice bowl, Salmon Rice Bowl and Sushi rolls (gunkan-maki)\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:48 The THREE Dishes we\u2019ll make\n01:13 Making the Sushi Rice\n02:52 Preparing our Negitoro Mixture\n05:07 If You Don\u2019t Have a Food Processor \n05:46 Toppings for Negitoro\n06:13 Negitoro Rice Bowl\n06:40 Making GUNKAN-MAKI (Sushi Roll)\n09:28 Let\u2019s Eat!\n\nIngredients:\n\nVinegared Sushi Rice (Su-meshi):\n\n- For 3 portions: 480f of Rice, 600ml Water (10% less than usual rice cooking)\n- Dried Kombu (Kelp), one piece (optional)\n- 60ml Rice Vinegar\n- 18g Sugar\n- 13g Salt\n\nNegitoro Mixture:\n\nIf you\u2019re not using a fatty piece of Tuna you can substitute the smooth fatty texture with this sauce \n\nNote: Half this recipe if you only are using 150g of fish (I used this for both pieces of fish in the video) \n\n- One Egg Yolk\n- 3g Sugar\n- 3g Salt\n- 100ml Grapeseed Oil\n\nYou can use either Tuna or Salmon for this recipe!\n- 150g Tuna or Salmon\n- 2 inches of Green Onion \n\nFor Rice Bowl/Sushi Roll Topping\n- 1tbsp of Sesame Seeds\n- Splash of Soy Sauce \n- Splash of Mirin\n- Scallions (as needed) \n- Nori Seaweed (sliced)\n\nFor Gunkan-maki Sushi Roll\u2019\n- Nori Seaweed, one sheet will make roughly 3 rolls\n\nHow to make: \n- First thing is to prepare your sushi rice - watch my previous video here on how to make rice without a rice cooker: \nhttps://youtu.be/BVgf5GOcCsQ\n\n- Remember to use 10% less water than normal as we will add vinegar later - so for 3 portions (480g Rice) add 600ml of water. You can add dried kelp (kombu) while steaming for extra umami flavor. \n- In a mixing bowl add 60ml of rice vinegar, 18g of sugar, and 13g of salt and mix until the sugar and salt dissolve - if you see undissolved pieces after mixing - drain with a fine sieve \n- When the rice is done cooking, transfer to a large bowl and add your rice mixture over the top. Slowly \u201ccut\u201d through the rice with a rice paddle or spatula while turning the bowl - make sure you don\u2019t crush the rice grains. Let cool - you can fan the rice to get rid of excess moisture from the steam.\n- If you are not using a fatty piece of tuna you can make a substitute for the \u201ctoro\u201d (fat) - mix one egg yolk, 3g of sugar, 3g of salt, and 1 tbsp of vinegar into a bowl and mix. Then gradually add 100ml of grape seed oil and mix until you see it begin to turn thick. \n\n\nIf you have a food processor:\n- Cut up your fish (tuna/salmon) into chunks, leave some to the side to give your negitoro a mix of textures. Also cut up 2 inches of green onion into small bits - leave a small piece aside too. \n- Place your fish and onion into a food processor and mix for a few seconds. Then add your Toro mixture (if you\u2019re using it) and the fish/green onion you left aside and mix for a few more seconds\n\nIf you\u2019re using a knife:\n- Cut up some green onion finely\n- Cut your fish into chunks and then tap your cutting board with your knife until your fish begins to dice into small pieces\n- Once you see it start to be diced into small pieces - add your toro mixture and green onions and keep tapping through with your knife (you can leave some bigger chunks for a change in texture) Keep doing this and fold over your mixture with your knife until you get a smooth mixture with a few chunks.\n\n- For toppings - take 1 tbsp of sesame seeds and fry with a splash of soy sauce and mirin in a frying pan for a minute. \n- Diced scallions are also a traditional topping too!\n\n- If you\u2019re making a rice bowl all you have to do is add your rice from before to a bowl, top off with your negitoro, toppings and some sliced nori seaweed. Then you\u2019re done.\n\n- If you\u2019re making gunkan-maki sushi rolls take some sheets of nori seaweed and slice lengthwise into thin strips (about 3cm in height)\n- Next set up a sushi making station with your negitoro, a bowl of water and your rice\n- Dip your fingers in water and cover your hands until wet\n- (if you are right handed) Take a small handful of sushi in your left hand and lay on your fingers - use your left thumb to make a dent into the sushi and then squeeze the tips of the rice with your right index finger and thumb \n- flip the rice over and squeeze the length of the sushi into a rectangle with the same fingers, use your right index finger to push the top to flatten (this may take a few tries to master! \u2026 or 3 years)\n- When all your sushi is made into little rectangle, rap the nori around them (the rough side should touch the rice)\n- Top off with your negitoro mixture and toppings and you\u2019re a sushi master!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "EASY Japanese Stew | Perfect for Winter", "description": "Hey guys! Happy new year! It\u2019s still really cold here in Japan so I thought I\u2019d kick off the new year with a video introducing Japanese NIMONO, a type of stew that is a great dish to warm you up in the winter!\n\nThis nimono I\u2019ll be using chicken thigh but feel free to mix things up and try whatever ingredients you want!\n\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:53 Make the Dashi Stock\n02:40 Prepare the Chicken Thigh\n03:07 Prepare the Vegetables\n04:44 Put our Stew Together\n07:20 Let's Eat!\n\nIngredients:\n\nHome-made Dashi:\n\n- 700ml Water\n- Dried Kombu (Kelp), one piece\n- 15g Katsuo-Bushi (Bonito Flakes)\n\nNimono Stew:\n- 350g Chicken\n- 1 Burdock Root\n- \u00bd Carrot \n- \u00bc Japanese Daikon Radish\n- 2 Shiitake Mushrooms\n- Green Beans (handful, in pod)\n- One Block of Konnyaku  (This is called devil\u2019s tongue in english!)\n\nHow to make: \n- Your Nimono Stew will taste better if you prepare a dashi stock beforehand, you can use water or store-bought packet dashi but if you want to make your own follow these steps:\n- Soak a piece of Kombu (dried kelp) in a saucepan with 700ml of water for 30 minutes \n- Turn on the heat and when the water starts to boil, remove the kombu or else your dashi may turn a bit bitter - also remove any foam from the liquid if you notice any.\n- Add 15g of katsuo-bushi (bonito flakes) to the water and then bring back to a boil - let that boil for 2-3 minutes\n- Then using a colander and kitchen towel/a clean kitchen cloth - drain your dashi stock and set aside\n\n- For the stew: \n- Remove any moisture from your chicken thigh with a paper towel and cut off any sinew or fatty parts of the chicken\n- Then heat a pan to a medium heat (you can use oil but if the chicken still has it\u2019s skin it will crisp up just fine) and place you chicken skin-side down\n- Cook until the skin of your chicken turns a nice golden color and remove - (you don\u2019t want to cook the chicken just give the skin a nice texture and render off some of the fat in the skin)\n- Now prepare your vegetables, (you can use anything you want in your nimono but I used the following)\n- \u00bc Daikon peeled and then cut into bite sized chunks, \u00bd carrot peeled and cut into chunks, 2 shiitake mushrooms with stalks removed and cut into chunks \n- For the burdock - scrape off the skin with your knife, cut off the hard end parts and wash - then cut diagonally so it absorbs more of your nimono stew \n- Cut the hard ends off the green beans \n- Now in a sauce-pan add your dashi stock from before (it probably evaporated a little to about 600ml at this stage), 2 tbsp sugar, 3 tbsp of mirin, 3 tbsp of soy sauce \nand bring to a boil \n- Then add your chicken and all the vegetables except the green beans \n- For the konnyaku, tear it up by hand and add it in - the rough edges help it better absorb the flavor \n- Use aluminum foil to create a \u2018lid\u2019 for your sauce-pan just a bit smaller than the pan - this will evaporate some of the liquid and help concentrate the flavor or your nimono as well as spread the flavors more evenly throughout all the ingredients \n- Let that sit for 20-30 minutes until the vegetables are soft (poke them with a skewer or chopstick to test)\n- Finally, add the green beans for 2-3 minutes with the foil lid back on and then take them out so they don\u2019t over-cook\n- Plate up your delicious and warm winter Nimono Stew", "rating": 1}, {"title": "WAGYU Beef Rice Bowl | Easy Japanese Recipe", "description": "Hey guys!

BE CAREFUL!\n- Once that\u2019s done add 2 tbsp of soy sauce and 2 tsp of brown sugar, and mix well, then set your saucepan into a bowl of cold water so it can cool quickly \n- Now prepare the steak - salt both sides of your meat and then brown the outsides of the steak in a frying pan quickly. You don\u2019t want to cook the steak through - just add some color. So it may take around 30 seconds to cook.\n- Peel one clove of garlic and grate finely. Add your marinade from before, the garlic and the steak into a zip-lock bag (that is suitable for high temperature cooking) and mix the ingredients together (make sure to get rid of as much air out of the bag as possible - you don\u2019t want it to float when you cooking)\n- Set a low temperature cooker to 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F) in a pot of water and add the steak with a clip when it\u2019s ready\n- Leave your steak to cook for 20 minutes (cooking time may vary depending on your cut of beef/steak)\n- While your steak is cooking prepare the rice and vegetables, if you want to make su-meshi or sushi rice mix 60ml of rice vinegar (or grain vinegar), 2 tsp sugar and 1 tsp of salt into a bowl until the salt and sugar are completely dissolved. \n- You will notice your mixture begin to foam as well, pour the liquid through a fine sieve and get rid of this foam \n- Put your cooked rice into a large mixing bowl and break it apart with a rice paddle, add the vinegar mixture to the rice and mix gently (you don\u2019t want to crush the rice grains so \u2018cut\u2019 the rice with the side of the paddle)\n- Cool your rice with a paper fan or something similar and set aside\n- Take asparagus and grate off the tough stems, cut each sprig in half and then prepare a pot of boiling water.\n- Add 1 tsp of salt to the water and then let the base of the asparagus cook for 30 seconds, then add the rest of the asparagus and cook for an additional minute - drain off with a colander. \n- Take \u00bd an onion and cut into rings - pull apart the rings and add them to boiling water to cook for 30 seconds once the water reaches a boil again - drain off the water and sprinkle with salt\n- Once your beef is done cooking, remove it from the bag and KEEP THE MARINADE! - add the marinade to the saucepan with 1/8th of a grated apple and simmer over a low heat until it begins to thicken. \n- Cut your beef into thin slices and then add your rice, vegetables and beef to a bowl. \n- If raw eggs are safe to eat in your country - top off with a egg yolk and enjoy your Wagyu Beef Bowl!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Make the Perfect RAMEN at Home | Simple Japanese Recipe", "description": "Hey guys!

Take 10g of dried kombu kelp and 20g of niboshi sardines and let soak in 1L of water for 30 minutes to an hour\n\nAJI-TAMA EGGS\n\n- Prepare the aji-tama soft boiled eggs (1 egg per serving). To make the eggs easier to peel, place a small hole in the round side of the egg before adding to boiling water for 6 minutes. \n- Once 6 minutes is up, take the eggs out and add immediately to cold water under a running tap for a minute \n- Peel the eggs and then in a ziplock bag add 7 tbsp soy sauce, 4 tbsp water, 1 tbsp mirin, 1 tsp cooking sake and 1 tsp sugar - mix the ingredients well and add the eggs - let sit for at least 30 minutes\n\nBROTH \n\n- Take your soaked ingredients from before and run the liquid through a sieve into a saucepan or stock-pot\n- Then add 450g of chicken mince (or chicken stock) and break apart with a spatula \n- Turn up to a medium heat and keep stirring to avoid the chicken clumping at the bottom of the pan\n- Add the niboshi sardines and kombu back from before\n- Keep stirring until you see the broth reach about 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0C) and the protein starts to float to the top of the liquid\n- Before the broth begins to boil - take out the kombu to avoid your soup becoming bitter\n- Put a lid on the broth and let simmer for 30 mins (check occasionally and get rid of any foam that surfaces on the top to improve the flavour)\n- Once 30 minutes is done - drain the ramen and remove all the solid ingredients - and your broth is done!\n\nRAMEN (FINISHING THE TOPPINGS)\n\n- Take \u00bc green onion and cut a slice down the outer layer - cut that into thin strips and let this soak in water for a few minutes\n- Then for the inner layer, chop this into small chunks - this will be a topping for your ramen \n-  Once 80 mins is done for your chashu pork, braize the outside fatty layer with a cooking blow-torch, oven or fry pan \n- Cut your pork into small medallions to add as a topping\n- Cut your aji-tama eggs in half - if they\u2019re cooked right they should still be slightly runny inside \n- Boil the noodles (either fresh or dried) for the time specified on the packaging - whilst the noodles are boiling, heat up your broth from before and also warm your ramen bowl with hot water\n- When the noodles are done cooking - throw away the water, add 360ml of your ramen broth to a bowl, add 1 tsp of salt and mix\n- Drain your noodles - add them to the broth - top with your onions, chashu pork and aji-tama and enjoy your perfect ramen!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Japan's BEST Katsudon | Crispy Pork Sauce Katsudon", "description": "Hey guys!

Give this a mix and set it aside\n- Take one large chicken breast and remove the skin. Cut into bite-size chunks about 1cm thick and add to your Warishita to marinate for 30 minutes\n- Next prepare your vegetables, thinly slice \u00bd onion and \u00bd green onion. An easy way to get thin strips with the green onion is to cut it into small pieces, then cut each piece in half without slicing all the way through. Spread it open like a book and then cut finely\n-  Once your chicken is done marinating, crack 3 eggs into a bowl and whisk - be careful not to over-mix - we don\u2019t want the yolk and egg white to be completely mixed.\n- Heat 1 tbsp of grape-seed oil over a medium-heat and begin to fry your onions until translucent and then begin to brown - add some salt while they\u2019re cooking to help release some of the moisture from the onions \n- Add the onions to your marinated chicken and then place that saucepan over a medium heat with the lid on\n- When that begins to boil you want to leave it cooking for about 3 minutes  (I cut up the chicken into 1cm chunks - but if your chicken pieces were bigger please boil for longer)\n- Once 3 minutes has passed add your sliced green onion and let cook for an extra minute with the lid on\n- Finally add your egg mixture about 2 ladle-fulls at a time. Put the lid on and wait for 20 seconds, repeat this step until you run out of egg mixture\n- Finally, plate up your oyakodon over rice and enjoy!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Perfect TEMPURA Batter at Home | Japanese Recipe", "description": "Hey guys!

I think this is also an interesting unconventional mechanic, one that translates well into VR, but right now there are very few fleshed out examples of it. Shattered Lights, Spellboud Spire, and Hyperbolica are really promising demos of the idea but at the moment but they are very short, so it was hard to fit it into a script which is already all about a certain mechanic (sound/physics). I will probably make a part 2 to this video in the future, part of which will include these games. Right now, i'm a little tired of wearing a headset all day! So the next video's gonna be non-vr.\n\n0:00 'Conventional' VR Games\n1:41 Stifled\n3:34 Stifled (Rating)\n3:42 Blind\n5:34 Blind (Rating)\n5:42 NO LONGER AVAILABLE (but still funny)\n6:38 Half-Life Alyx (no spoilers)\n8:16 Half-Life Alyx (YES SPOILERS)\n10:34 Half-Life Alyx (Rating)\n10:40 Outro\n\n'FUNKe Study' is a series of reviews, sometimes quickfire and sometimes longform typically centered around unorthodox/novel media that I find worth highlighting.

I built the aforementioned 3 lane map, some rudimentary movement, and a weapon that launched bombs a-la the loose cannon. I lost the files to this last october during a computer re-build, and since this video is more performative than it is practical I didn't really want to try and remake it again. Maybe things will change and i'll try to make games myself one day, but that's not really how I balance my plate right now.

It is a free font that you can download. The font used in this video is \"Buran USSR\" which is also a free font.\nPreviously I used a full white fill colour for the font but on this video the text is HEX code: FFFCEB. This is a slightly yellow colour that is easier to read and causes less strain on the eyes.\n\nThere is much more that goes into making the subtitles that i clearly could not fit in the video. For example the placing of the text of the subtitles has to be times accurately when there is a lot of words being spoken in a row.\nI used to try and put subtitles on two lines but that looked bad. So now I only use one line of text always.\n\nThere is a lot of style elements also that go into making the subtitles the way that they are. For example I only always us an ellipsis with tho periods (..) instead of three which is the usual (...)\n\nI always try to place no more than 6 words on one line because it could get hard to read. I never use periods on the ends of lines. When using a foreign language when speaking, I usually mark it in subtitles with a different colour so that the reader does not get confused. This way the viewer can go and look up the word online.\n\nThe size of subtitles has changed considerably over the years. It started as a very big size (how to slav your car) and then dropped to a very small size (cheburek video).\n\nSubtitles are also a nice way to add small easter eggs into videos. Not everyone reads subtitles so not everyone sees them.\n\nJust to clarify, subtitles that I add on videos are not the same as YouTube CC. CC means closed captions. Closed captions are \"closed\" when video starts, meaning they are invisible. \"Opening\" the captions means making them visible for the duration of the video. \nMost channels that have clear speaking people, have automatic CC that is actually pretty accurate.\nCC on my channel has to be manually input because since my accent is so bad, YouTube recognises me as speaking Russian. So it tries to understand what I'm saying in Russian. But I'm not speaking Russian.\n\nProudly powered by Patreon: https://patreon.com/lifeofboris\n\ud83d\udc55 True Slav Merch Shop: https://www.borismerch.com/\nBoris chairs and Gaming Gear: https://uvi.gg/weslav/\n\nIntro music:\nGopnik McBlyat - Snakes in Tracksuits\nOutro music:\nCheeki Breeki Hardbass Anthem", "rating": 2}, {"title": "-10 000 SUBSCRIBER SPECIAL (glorious 144p quality)", "description": "this video is intentionally in only 144p. video upload quality has nothing to do with how findable it is or how often it is suggested. sound is still really high quality thouth. oh yes and 10 000 subscribers have left.\nafter recording the video i realised my eyes were too visible in this light so instead of blurring 10 minutes of video I just slammed the quality to a nice slav 144p.\n\noh yes don't forget to leave a comment about the new subtitles\n\nProudly powered by Patreon: https://patreon.com/lifeofboris\n\ud83d\udc55 True Slav Merch Shop: https://www.borismerch.com/\nBoris chairs and Gaming Gear: https://uvi.gg/weslav/\n\nIntro music:\nGopnik McBlyat - Snakes in Tracksuits\nOutro music:\nCheeki Breeki Hardbass Anthem", "rating": 2}, {"title": "ONLY WATCH WHEN BROKE \ud83e\udd54 three new potato recipes (vareniki, draniki)", "description": "pelmeni video: https://youtu.be/YO7AdLsUSec\nepic hardbass in background by uamee:\nhttps://youtu.be/DYN0jhgrDwM\nAnatoli's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI2KQtPVGTH4Lh7c2qUb3JQ\n\nProudly powered by Patreon: https://patreon.com/lifeofboris\n\ud83d\udc55 True Slav Merch Shop: https://www.borismerch.com/\nBoris chairs and Gaming Gear: https://uvi.gg/weslav/\n\nINGREDIENTS:\nFirst recipe - potato\nIngredients: potato\n\nSecond recipe - draniki\ningredients:\n5 small potatos\n1 small onion\n1 egg\n3tbsp flour\nsome salt and pepper\n\nThird recipe - vareniki\ningredients:\nDOUGH: \n250ml water\n1 egg\n2tsp salt\n300g wheat flour or more\nFILLING:\npotato\nsalt and pepper\n\nIntro music:\nGopnik McBlyat - Snakes in Tracksuits\nOutro music:\nCheeki Breeki Hardbass Anthem", "rating": 2}, {"title": "PLANS FOR 2022", "description": "\ud83d\udc55 True Slav Merch Shop: https://www.borismerch.com/\nBoris chairs and Gaming Gear: https://uvi.gg/weslav/\nProudly powered by Patreon: https://patreon.com/lifeofboris\n\nIntro music:\nGopnik McBlyat - Snakes in Tracksuits\nOutro music:\nCheeki Breeki Hardbass Anthem", "rating": 2}, {"title": "How to make Russian Crab Salad (\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442) - Cooking with Boris", "description": "It's like the universal Russian food for all celebrations.

This trip was well planned! We did a few things differently to increase everyone\u2019s safety like using cars instead of the tube, having a reduced team on the shoot to minimise numbers, and spreading out into a bigger studio etc etc. You will note that when I\u2019m being photographed, having my makeup done or presenting clips to cam stood alone, I am not wearing a mask. This is allowed (a bit like films, tv or modelling, not that I\u2019d call myself a \u2018model haha) and we made sure to all stay apart. I won\u2019t lie, it felt a bit weird to note be covered up 100% of the time, I\u2019ve become SO used to it!\n\nI conducted a poll on instagram and asked if you wanted to see disclaimers like this across content (you know me, I'm a people pleaser) and over 28,000 of you said no, you just wanted to see the lifey bits. So, I'm jotting in this bit rather than waffling on in the video.\n\nI know there will come a time where people are less and less required to distance or mask and I know the rules are different in other regions/countries but I just thought I\u2019d leave that there for anyone who has a particular interest in it. I'm not sure how many videos I'll do this for, will have to just gauge the reaction.

I started this channel in 2010 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here.

This allows us to influence the game into providing a specific outcome to most battles, level ups, and item drops in the first 32 minutes of the run.\n\nJoin the EB speedrun community discord!\nhttps://discord.gg/hPQ4CmT\n\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/doctorswellman \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/drswellman \n\n#EarthBound #WorldRecord #Glitchless", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Can Our GIANT HAMMER Break Into This BANK SAFE??", "description": "Get NordVPN exclusive deal here: https://nordvpn.com/howridiculous and try it risk-free thanks to their money-back guarantee!\n\nWatch Demo Ranch\u2019s Video: https://youtu.be/Lj6_5AuR4Q4\n\nThanks to Richard for being a legend and bringing some safes to the party!

I could've spent hours going into all of the intricacies of this conflict and tried to stay balance and unbiased as I simply came an observer.\n\nVarosha is one of the largest and most tragic ghost towns on the planet. Once filled with tens of thousands of tourists every year it's been abandoned now for about 47 years... The conflict in Cyprus is far from being resolved and unfortunately is growing in complexity as the years go by. Sending hope and positivity to all the Cypriots out there, thank you for hosting me in your country.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort \n\u26a1\ufe0f SEEK DISCOMFORT: http://seek-discomfort.com/yes-theory\n\n\u2708 Book an Adventure: https://travel.yestheory.com/\n\nJOIN OUR COMMUNITY\n\u207a Yes Theory Plus: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTd7KzdwnFE3lm6LCfYDmUQ\n\ud83d\udcdd Follow Matt\u2019s Newsletter: http://yestheory.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram -  https://www.instagram.com/yestheory/\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter - https://twitter.com/yestheory\n\ud83c\udfac  Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/yestheory/\n\n\u262e\ufe0f If you want to join the Yes Fam Facebook group which is 100,000+ of our most engaged and badass community members, you can apply here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/yesfam/\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 HOW WE MAKE OUR VIDEOS\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 Where we find our music:\n1- Epidemic Sound.

Considered dangerous to travel to by some familiar with the region.. They decided to travel there without any itinerary and see what they find.\n\nThis idea was submitted to us by Nick Bowlby in our Creative Internship program we hosted last year!

But the truth is, there are certain pre-established forms that I like to use to ensure my freestyle performances function more like actual songs as opposed to just extended free-flows. Some of you have probably seen examples of this in Omegle Bars; for instance when I take 3 words, spin them all into a hook, and then proceed to do a verse dedicated to each of those 3 words. That\u2019s just one example of a form I might use to give structure to my improvisation. In addition, the live show is packed with a bunch of different segments that showcase different sides of my freestyling. But the biggest reason I like to rehearse is to build chemistry with my DJ @Sur Jazz \ud83d\udcaa He\u2019s a huge part of the overall sound and vibe we bring on stage, and I\u2019m super lucky to have him on board for my tour. In this video, you get to take a behind-the-scenes look at how we get the creative juices flowing and prepare to absolutely demolish these stages.

Oh how I used to love breaking the rules and viciously stabbing that flimsy yellow straw right through the side of the packaging (rather than through the convenient little entry point they put there for the boring rule-followers among us \ud83d\ude44). Let\u2019s be real- it\u2019s hard to earn your cool points as a 1st grader in the American public school system; sometimes you just have to get creative with your juice consumption strategy to prove your edginess. And if sipping juice out of a plastic pouch that you\u2019ve just brutally stabbed while basking in the Sun on the Italian island of Capri doesn\u2019t ping any nostalgic memories for you\u2026 maybe you played \u201cSonic\u201d for Sega Genesis, or watched the cartoon series \u201cRecess\u201d, or at the very least cracked up at Bart yelling \u201ceat my shorts!\u201d while remaining completely oblivious to the fact that so many funnier jokes would only enter your comprehension years later in life. And if none of that means anything to you then I guess our respective childhoods are nothing alike.

I often mention how important my drumming has been to my development as a freestyler, and to my understanding of music in general. Back at the old home studio I didn\u2019t have enough space to keep my drums set up all the time, and as a result I spent a lot less time playing them. One of the best parts about moving into my new studio space has been always having my kit set up and ready to play. Over the course of the past few months I\u2019ve been really reconnecting with the instrument, and in the last couple weeks especially I\u2019ve been playing almost daily. It\u2019s been enriching for my soul, and I\u2019m excited to share a little piece of that with y\u2019all.\n\nThe beats I\u2019m playing are lifted from some of the most sampled records of all time. These breaks (the original ones) are foundational to the DNA of hip-hop. My verses were freestyled completely off-top and I attempted to weave in a bunch of references- some to artists and groups who have sampled the breaks themselves, as well as other musical (and some non-musical) influences and inspirations. 20,000 Mack points to the first person who successfully identifies every allusion made!! \n\nCombining rhythm and language is what I\u2019m all about, and this video is intended to show that connection. The first instruments utilized by human beings were drums (or probably sticks on cave walls) and the voice. There\u2019s something visceral and deep about the stripped down sound of those two instruments alone. I had a lot of fun making this video and I hope y\u2019all dig it!

Learning that Nas did the entire first verse of \u201cNY State of Mind\u201d in one take with his whole crew in the booth with him, or that Slum Village laid all the vocals for \u201cFan-Tas-Tic (Volume 1)\u201d to a click track and then Dilla created the beats after the fact (what???? ), or that Bill Withers\u2019 band grooved on \u201cUse Me\u201d for 10 minutes straight in the studio before Bill laid his vocals (so that what we hear as the downbeat of the album track is actually preceded by a long stretch of hypnotic grooving that went straight to the cutting room floor\u2026 there\u2019s one way to make sure the pocket is deep right from the \u201cfirst notes\u201d)\u2026 this is the type of stuff that really gets me fired up.\n\nFor myself as a rapper, PROCESS has always been a huge part of my story. Freestyling off-top is all about improvising new lyrics in the spur of the moment. Fans of Freestyle Rappers are typically less interested in hearing them recite their pre-existing lyrics verbatim, and much more excited to watch the PROCESS unfold as the emcee cooks up brand new lyrics in the moment, based on their mood, the latest article they read, the vibe of the beat, the energy in the room, visual stimuli, or the topic suggestion they\u2019ve just been given. \u201cFreestyling\u201d quite literally describes a PROCESS, and thus a Freestyle Rapper is someone known for their mastery of a particular PROCESS. \n\nWith this project, I wanted to experiment with a few different PROCESSES to challenge myself creatively and see what emotions/vibes I could channel. The first 2 songs are extremely raw and vulnerable, the last song is much more polished. I think both approaches have merit and can lead to interesting results. In general, it\u2019s much scarier to release music that isn\u2019t based on someone else\u2019s words (a la Omegle Bars) because I don\u2019t have that safety net of saying \u201coh yeah, well I just rapped about that because they asked me to.\u201d But as I say in the last song: \u201cmy theory is embrace fear\u201d, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in deciding to release these tracks out into the wild. I hope you enjoy, and I\u2019m super curious to hear which PROCESS yielded the most enjoyable results for you as a listener- let me know in the comments.\n\nMuch love!\nMack \n\n#HarryMack #Freestyle #SOULilloquies\n\nINSTRUMENTALS\n1) 'Blood, Sweat, and Tears' (Prod.

Next we took it to the LEGENDARY San Jose Improv - a stage that\u2019s been graced by the likes of Harry Houdini & Charlie Chaplin - where I performed for the hypest audience I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to rock for (shout out to The Bay, y\u2019all are my heart \u2764\ufe0f). Lastly we did some dope pop-up performances at SF Ski Fest (and we mayyyy have even found some time to sneak in a bayside Guerrilla Bars shoot for good measure).

I add spices, such as gochujang with is a red chili paste that is sweet, with fermented spicy chili powder. Or you could use the instant ramen noodles called \"Rabokki.\" Rabokki noodle is made for the tteokbokki or the spicy rice cakes to be added to the mix. Rabokki is actually my favorite Korean ramen instant noodles of ALL TIME. Seriously, if I could only eat one Instant korean ramyeon aka Ramyun for the rest of my life, it would be Rabokki Instant Ramen Noodles, with cheese and rice cakes added. So sit back and relax and watch up cook up this delicious Easy Spicy Cheesy Rice Cakes mukang eating show!

As ya'll know, I've been separated from my ex husband Orlin Home for 2 months now, and we are in the filing process of the divorce. I packed my bags and moved to Las Vegas, a place I have always enjoyed for the food and company. I've been very fortunate and blessed, especially in 2020, despite the hardships in my marriage, from creating my new Mukbang channel called \"More Nikocado\" as well as monetizing myself on a few other platforms outside of YouTube. I truly owe this new home to all of you. This condo rests near the Las Vegas strip and was on the market for only a few months before I was able to purchase it back in January of 2021. If you may recall, my daily mukbang videos involved lots of hints of \"a big surprise is coming but I can't tell you yet\" type of stuff. Down below me is hotel, casino and spa. I'm so close to all of my favorite foods and the building has great security, which is why I feel comfortable publishing my location like this.

Play alone or team up in online co-op. Explore the streets of Praslav, scavenge for food and supplies, beg, steal, and do whatever else it takes to survive the forthcoming winter.\n\nWelcome to Praslav, a cold Central European city that grows even colder with the coming winter. Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades.\n\nWhile most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the streets with nowhere to go.\n\nYou are one of those people.\n\nKeep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways - staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point.\n\nHow far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely outweigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are.\n\nSpend the last few days of autumn wisely \u2013 gather supplies, equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty - every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again.\n\nUnlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav.\n\nMaybe there is no warm apartment waiting for you at the end of the day, but you do not have to keep sleeping on park benches either. Find a suitable place and get to work. Construct walls and roofs to shield you from the elements. Gather discarded furniture and curios to furnish your hideout and make it truly your own.\n\nIs surviving on your own too difficult? Get the gang together. The game supports online co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. Play alone, together with your friends, or even with total strangers. Team up, collect resources, build a shanty town, survive the winter.\n\nFor over a decade, no one has been able to bring the many factions of the homeless together. The throne of the Homeless King has been sitting empty for far too long. Who will earn enough respect and prove themselves worthy of uniting the homeless? Will you rise to the occasion?", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I Built a Theme Park That Ends Reality in Planet Coaster", "description": "Download WARPATH through my link: https://patron.me/LGIOWarpath\nUse my creator code to get awesome in-game rewards: WARPATH2021\nJoin the event to have a chance to win a PS5, Switch, or tons of Amazon Cards.

But Crab Game got millions of downloads (10m at the time of writing this), and now netflix might be out to get me, so i have to update crab game and make it different, so netflix doesnt destroy me for copying squid game. haha cool\n\n//about\nHey!

This is the first part, I'll make the next one soon enough. There was just too much footage to fit into one video.

It ended up being not the best idea ever, and theres even this thing called google cardboard vr, so google straight copied me, but its fine, as long as google accepts my boxing match invitation. Anyway in the next episode we'll make a proper vr headset with arms, so i dont have to use my face to scream with, cuz thats kinda hard. Making a vr headset and vr games was fun tho, and ill probably get my hands on a real vr headset soon, maybe the valve index or like the oculus rift s or maybe just the oculus quest. all the games are made with unity btw, but i didnt use the vr support cuz im dumb lol. anyway thanks for watching and why are you reading this? you know this is just metadata right get outta here kiddo before i slamdunk\n\nAnyway would you wanna see me make a proper vr game with a proper vr headset? could be fun, and i think its pretty easy to make vr games with unity, so ill probbaly do it gamers\n\nAlso if you wanna try this for yourself, there are many video on youtube actually, like \"how to make virtual reality cardboard headset\" or something like that, and usually they make vr headsets from stuff you can find in your home, so its something to try out. tho obviously if you have some milk cartons lying around, i recommend you try building the oculus milk, as its an absolute unstoppable machine\n\n//about\nHey!

Then I build a game where a bunch of cubes fight eacother, and finally load the comments into the players.

For the first part of the game, I will focus on making a bunch of minigames you play with your friends, or bots if you dont have any friends like me haha anyway all the previous progress is definitely not lost. I'm probably going to add parts of it as their own minigames later on. And even if I don't, I will still take with me all the experience from previously developing, as seen in the devlogs. \nHopefully this way, development should be much quicker, and I might actually be able to release it sometime in 2020, but I'm not too sure on the date yet, as I'm still working on a lot of planning, and i also have a ton of other game / video ideas. \nAnyway, thanks for sticking around, this is gonne be sick\n\n\n//about\nHey!

The taste was so perfect, but the texture was just divine. I knew I had to come up with my own recipe to recreate this scrambled egg masterpiece. \n\nThese eggs reminded me so much of being in France. And if there\u2019s one thing the French know, it\u2019s how to make eggs; trust me on this one! \n\nWhen I went to purchase the eggs to make this recipe they didn\u2019t have the organic eggs I normally buy. I thought about getting the free range eggs but they\u2019re honestly just not the same. A lot of marketing goes into those egg labels but everyone knows that organic is always best. I ended up walking 7 minutes to another store to find the organic ones, and boy was it well worth it. Plus I burned of some extra calories which really revved up my appetite! \n\nI harvested the chives from a friends herb garden. I\u2019m sure going to owe her one! I guess I\u2019m gonna have to make her one of those mimosas ;) \n\nAlright, well let\u2019s get to it. The recipe: \n\n3 organic eggs \nFresh chives \nFresh ricotta cheese \nSalted organic butter \nSalt and pepper to taste \n\nFinely chop the chives until you have around a tablespoon or so. Remember this doesn\u2019t have to be perfect! I end up putting in a different amount every time.\n\nCrack three eggs into a bowl and whisk. Feel free to add in some salt and don\u2019t let anyone tell you it makes the eggs tough or watery! Salt breaks down protein and if anything it will make them just slightly more tender. \n\nHeat your pan to medium low. Be patient with this. Add in some butter (not too much!) then pour in your eggs. \n\nScrape the bottom of the pan with your silicone spatula until the eggs are almost set, just a bit undercooked. \n\nStir in two tablespoons or so of fresh ricotta cheese, and remove the pan from the heat.\n\nSpoon the eggs onto some delicious whole grain toast and serve with fruit of choice. The contract in texture between the crunch toast and the soft eggs is to die for. \n\nNow that\u2019s what I call perfect scrambled eggs :) \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Onion Rings (episode 124)", "description": "Thank you to Bushmills Whiskey for sponsoring this video  http://www.inflcr.co/SH6HK\n\nDeep fried onion rings are one of the best edible hoops in existence. Onion rings are far better than apple rings, carrot rings, and also rings. \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\nhttp://yousuckatcooking.com\n\nBefore we get into the recipe, let's talk safety. A hot pot full of oil is super dangerous. You can deep fry safely but you have to know what you're doing. The first time I tried it, I was dipping my meat thermometer in the oil to keep track of the temperature. This was colossally stupid. You need a dedicated thermometer on your pot so you can watch constantly and so you won't drop it inside. Better yet, a dedicated deep fryer is really the way to go, and you can just read the instruction manual. Long story short, if your oil temperature gets out of control a fire can start, and you can't put it out with water, you either have to smother it or use a fire extinguisher. Also, the oil takes FOREVER to cool down, so many sure anyone in your house knows not to touch it when you're done using it. It also takes FOREVER to heat up so it's super tempting to turn up the temperature, which is a mistake (on my stovetop, 350 F was just below the number 4. Anyway, read this guide if you think you actually want to try deep frying, and then just order onion rings from the bar instead. \n\nDeep Fry Safety \nhttps://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-deep-fry-safely\n\nRecipe \n\nSlice some onions and make rings\nRemove tape\nYeah basically take any onion you like \nAdd \u00be cup of flour and \u00bc cup corn starch to a bowl \nThen add spices; cayenne, chilli powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, whatever. Let's say around a tablespoon total \nAdd around a cup of soda water, more or less, depending on how buck wild you've gone with the spices. One description I read about the thickness is that it should be like thick paint. \n\nHeat 3 or so inches of peanut oil to 350 degrees F in a tall sturdy pot (not non stick)\nPreferably on your back burner so it won't get knocked. If your vessel has handles, make sure they are not sticking out \nI see a lot of people use their fingers to put things into the oil. I don't like this method because that's too close for comfort. The spider strainer, in my opinion, is the best way to go. The chance of dropping something in the oil is very minimal. If you're going to use tongs, grip tightly, and I don't recommend silicon tipped tongs because they are slippery. You REALLY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE AN OIIL SPLASH \nSo use your spider strainer to lower an undoh ring into the oil\nAfter a minute or a minute and a half, flip it, then take it out after another minute. Just trust your eyes in terms of how cooked you want it \nI highly recommend setting a timer each time you put a batch in as it's easy to get distracted for one minute and you really have to have your head in the game for as long as you are deep frying \nPlace onion rings on a wire rack with paper towels underneath. If you don't have a wire rack you can place them on paper towels on a plate or in a bowl \nWhen you're all done, move that oil to the back burner if it's not already there (very, very carefully, using oven mitts), and make sure everyone knows not to touch it for a couple hours. Keep your thermometer in there so you know when it's completely cooled\nThen you can either save it or dispose of it. Here's a helpful guide on how to dispose of the oil...long story short, it will end up in the trash, not the sink or toilet \nhttps://www.thespruceeats.com/how-do-i-dispose-of-used-cooking-oil-908995\n\nThanks!
